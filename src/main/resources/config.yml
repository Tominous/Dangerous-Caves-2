# NOTE: Chances
# All the chances are in percents
# Setting chance to 0 means that you want to disable the feature

# NOTE: Worlds
# World names are case-sensitive
# Instead of specifying worlds you can leave them blank - all the OVERWORLD worlds will be used automatically
# "Blank worlds" doesn't means "worlds:" - use "worlds: []"

# NOTE: Ticks
# Plugin utilizes it's own tick system which is based on vanilla one
# WORLD tick is 6300 vanilla ticks (about 5 minutes 15 seconds)
# ENTITY tick is 4 vanilla ticks (about 200 milliseconds)
